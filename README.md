Advancing Malaria Identification From Microscopic Blood Smears Using Hybrid Deep Learning Frameworks

üìú Abstract
Malaria remains a critical global health threat, particularly in tropical regions. Due to inadequate detection and the limitations of conventional methods, there is a pressing need for smarter, faster, and more cost-effective detection systems. This project presents a hybrid deep learning framework that combines CNN for feature extraction with cascaded RNN classifiers (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU) to advance malaria detection from microscopic blood smear images.
Our best-performing model (CNN-LSTM-BiLSTM) achieves an impressive 96.20% accuracy while maintaining minimal type-I and type-II errors, making it ideal for resource-constrained, point-of-care IoT devices.
